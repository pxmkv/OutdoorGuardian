ESP-IDF V4.0 has a new CMake-based build system as the default build system.

There is a new ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin that works with the CMake-based build system. Please refer to `Espressif IDF Eclipse Plugins <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_ IDF for further instructions.
